Theory of the 2 COVID tests
In this PDF the computation of the probability of being Sick (S) after 2 tests (2 pos and 1 pos/1 neg) is developped thanks to the modified Bayes's rule
as well as the regular mathematics formulas for conditional probability. 
It is an interesting problem because it allows to give more credit to the tests you're taking, for any disease. 
Below is given you the capacity to determine on your own the probability you have to be sick after taking 2 tests and therefore to act in consequences. 

This computation has been made with the following given data: 
- The 1st test is positive 
- P(S)= 0.0001 [i.e., the probability that someone in your demographic has this sickness is of 0.01%];
- P(_T|S) = 1−P(T|S) = 0.001 [i.e., the probability of a false negative test is 0.1%];
- P(T|_S) = 0.0005 [i.e., the probability of a false positive test is 0.05%];
- P(T) = P(T|S)P(S)+P(T|S)P(S) = 0.999 ∗0.0001+0.0005 ∗0.9999≈ 0.0006 [i.e., the overall probability
of positive test is 0.06%].

Thanks for reading this and good luck using the formula !
